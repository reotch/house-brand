Solimo Wipes Project
-----

This is a *Front-End Friday* project that aims to emulate a generic can of Solimo Disinfecting Wipes, which I'm currently depleting in the age of COVID-19.

This can is modern generic. It has a combination of fonts, grouped in different areas with a lot of white space. If I can, I'll throw some animated, angled block elements in the yellow of the top, bottom, and side.

For reference, here is the can:<br />
